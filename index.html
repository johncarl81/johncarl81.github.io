            <i>John Ericksen, G. Matthew Fricke, Scott Nowicki, Tobias P. Fischer, Julie C. Hayes, Karissa Rosenberger, Samantha R. Wolf, Rafael Fierro, and Melanie E. Moses</i>
            <p>We present methods for autonomous collaborative surveying of volcanic CO2 emissions using aerial robots. CO2 is a useful predictor of volcanic eruptions and an influential greenhouse gas.
              However, current CO2 mapping methods are hazardous and inefficient, as a result, only a small fraction of CO2 emitting volcanoes have been surveyed. We develop algorithms and a platform
              to measure volcanic CO2 emissions. The Dragonfly Unpiloted Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform is capable of long-duration CO2 collection flights in harsh environments. We implement two survey
              algorithms on teams of Dragonfly robots and demonstrate that they effectively map gas emissions and locate the highest gas concentrations. Our experiments culminate in a successful field
              test of collaborative rasterization and gradient descent algorithms in a challenging real-world environment at the edge of the Valles Caldera supervolcano. Both algorithms treat multiple
              flocking UAVs as a distributed flexible instrument. Simultaneous sensing in multiple UAVs gives scientists greater confidence in estimates of gas concentrations and the locations of sources
              of those emissions. These methods are also applicable to a range of other airborne concentration mapping tasks, such as pipeline leak detection and contaminant localization.</p>

            <p>
              Measurement of volcanic CO2 flux by a drone
              swarm poses special challenges. Drones must be able to follow
              gas concentration gradients while tolerating frequent drone loss.
              We present the LoCUSalgorithm as a solution to this problem
              and prove its robustness. LoCUS relies on swarm coordination
              and self-healing to solve the task. As a point of contrast we also
              implement the MoBSalgorithm, derived from previously published work, which allows drones to solve the task independently.
              We compare the effectiveness of these algorithms using drone
              simulations, and find that LoCUS provides a reliable and efficient
              solution to the volcano survey problem. Further, the novel datastructures and algorithms underpinning LoCUS have application
              in other areas of fault-tolerant algorithm research.

            <i>John Ericksen, Abhinav Aggarwal, Melanie E. Moses</i>
            <p>
              In this paper, we perform an ablation study of neatfa, a neuro-evolved foraging algorithm that has recently been shown to forage efficiently under different resource distributions. Through selective disabling of input signals, we identify a \emph{sufficiently} minimal set of input features that contribute the most towards determining search trajectories which favor high resource collection rates. Our experiments reveal that, independent of how the resources are distributed in the arena, the signals involved in imparting the controller the ability to switch from searching of resources to transporting them back to the nest are the most critical. Additionally, we find that pheromones play a key role in boosting performance of the controller by providing signals for informed locomotion in search for unforaged resources.

              This paper focuses on the problem of swarm foraging, proposing an automated method for designing scalable controllers that can perform effectively in multiple foraging environments.
              We use Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) to design a neural network controller for a swarm of homogeneous robots.
              Our system, called NeatFA (NEAT Foraging Algorithm), is compared to existing swarm foraging algorithms...

            <i>John Ericksen, Melanie Moses, Stephanie Forrest</i>
            <p>
              In this thesis, we examine the approach of a metaprogramming tool named Transfuse.
              Transfuse targets boilerplate reduction within the constraints prescribed by the Android environment.
              This is accomplished through compile-time analysis and code generation.
              This approach is analyzed from both boilerplate reduction and run-time performance perspectives.

              Parceler is an Android code generation library used to generate implementations of the Parcelable interface.
              Implementing this interface is fraught with boilerplate, including defining a <code>public static final CREATOR</code> field and <code>writeToParcel()</code> and <code>createFromParcel()</code>.
              With Parceler you simply annotate a POJO with <code>@Parcel</code> and Parceler does the rest.

              Traditionally, Javadocs have mixed minor markup with HTML which, if you’re writing for HTML Javadoc output, becomes unreadable and hard to write over time.
              This is where lightweight markup languages like AsciiDoc thrive.
              AsciiDoc straddles the line between readable markup and beautifully rendered content.
              Asciidoclet incorporates an AsciiDoc renderer (Asciidoctor via the Asciidoctor Java integration library) into a simple Doclet that enables AsciiDoc formatting within Javadoc comments and tags.

              Thermoduino is the output of some tinkering with writing my own thermostat with the goal of controlling my house's temperature from multiple rooms over the day (bedroom for night and living room for day for instance).
              In the end, I never added the relay to control a thermostat in my home.
              What I did do is network 3 Arduinos using xbee wireless mesh network devices to gather the temperatures from the kitchen, office, and living room.
              I then randomly choose one of these rooms every 3 hours and tweet the temperature.
